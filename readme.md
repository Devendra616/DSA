# Learn and Practice DSA with JavaScript

This is repository which is intended to enhance my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills using JavaScript! This is a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to understand the core concepts of DSA and apply them through coding exercises in JavaScript.

## What's Inside?

This repository is structured to take you through various fundamental data structures, their associated algorithms, and practice problems to solidify your understanding.

### Data Structures

- **Stack**: A linear data structure following the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. [Learn more](1.stack/)
- **Queue**: Another linear structure but follows FIFO (First In First Out). [Explore Queue](2.queue/)
- **Linked List**: A collection of nodes connected together in a sequence.
  - **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next.This is one directional ie from Head to last node. [Dive into SLL](3.linkedList/readme.md)
  - **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes can traverse both forwards and backwards. [Understand DLL](3.linkedList/readme.md)

### Algorithms

Discover various algorithms that operate on these data structures, from basic traversal to more complex manipulations like insertion, deletion, search etc. Each section includes explanations, and JavaScript implementations to help you grasp the concepts quickly.
